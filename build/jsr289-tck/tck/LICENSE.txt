2.0 LICENSE GRANTS 

2.1 License Grant for the TCK. 
    (a)	Limited Grant. Subject to Your compliance with the restrictions and obligations contained in this Agreement, including but not limited the Additional Limitations set forth in subsection (b) below, BEA hereby grants You, to the extent of BEA's Intellectual Property Rights in the TCK(s), a worldwide, non-exclusive, limited license, with right to sublicense, to use the TCK(s) internally and solely for the purpose of developing and testing Your Products. No license is granted for any other purpose, including any of the activities described in Section 2.1(b).
    (b)	Additional Limitations. You may not:  
        (i) create derivative works of the TCK(s) or 
        (ii) disassemble or decompile binary portions of the test suite(s) or testing tools or otherwise attempt to derive the source code from such portions or 
        (iii) use any marks, brands or logos associated with the JCP Specification, or otherwise promote or market any product, or code, which implements any portion of the JCP 
              Specification, as being compatible, compliant, conformant or otherwise consistent with the JCP Specification unless such product passes, in accordance with the 
              documentation (including the TCK Users Guide, if any), the most current TCK applicable to the latest version of the JCP Specification and available from BEA one 
              hundred twenty (120) days before FCS of such version of the product; provided, however, that if You elect to use a version of the TCK also provided by BEA that is 
              newer than that which is required under this Section 2.1(b)(iii), then You agree to pass such TCK.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not 
              modify any portions of the TCK that are provided in source code format.	
    (c) Testing. You shall self-certify that Your product implementing the JCP Specification passes the applicable TCK as set forth above, if and when such product in 
        fact does so, provided that if BEA reasonably believes that Your product does not pass the applicable TCK, BEA may require You to submit specific test documentation to 
        an independent third party audit facility designated by BEA, for verification of proper compatibility testing..  If the audit determines that such Product does not pass 
        the TCK, 
        (i) You shall be responsible for all reasonable costs of such audit including but not limited to the costs of retesting, and 
        (ii) You shall within 90 days of receipt of notice that the Product does not pass the TCK modify the Product so that it does pass the TCK and resubmit it to the third 
             party auditor for retesting.  If you do not comply with subsection (ii) of this Section (c) you shall immediately cease use of any marks, brands or logos 
             associated with the JCP Specification, and shall otherwise cease to promote or market any product, or code, which implements any portion of the JCP Specification, 
             as being compatible, compliant, conformant or otherwise consistent with the JCP Specification.  

2.2  Proprietary Rights Notices. You shall not remove any copyright notices, trademark notices or other proprietary legends of BEA or its suppliers contained on or in the TCK, 
     and shall incorporate such notices in all copies of any TCK. You shall comply with all reasonable requests by BEA to include additional copyright or other proprietary 
     rights notices of BEA or third parties from time to time.

2.3  Ownership. You acknowledge and agree that, as between BEA and You, nothing in this Agreement transfers any right, title and interest in and to the TCK, any derivative works 
     thereof and Intellectual Property Rights (excluding any pre-existing Intellectual Property Rights owned by You) associated therewith, to You.

2.4  No Other Grant. This Agreement does not grant to You any right or license, under any Intellectual Property Rights of BEA or otherwise, except as expressly provided in this 
     Section 2, and no other right or license is to be implied by or inferred from any provision of this Agreement or by the conduct of the parties.


3.0 SUPPORT AND UPGRADES

Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate BEA to provide any technical support, updates, newer versions of or other assistance concerning the TCK to You or to any of Your 
distributors or customers for Your products.  BEA, it its sole option, may elect to make technical support for the TCK available pursuant a separate agreement.


4.0 LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER

THE TCK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE TCK 
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE TCK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE TCK PROVE 
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT BEA OR ANY OF ITS CONTRIBUTORS OR SUPPLIERS) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF THE TCK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.


5.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BEA, OR ANY OF ITS CONTRIBUTORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO 
ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER 
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF 
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


6.0 TERM AND TERMINATION

6.1  Term. The Term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue unless terminated as provided below. Termination is permitted:  
     (a) by either party for the other party's breach of this Agreement, upon written notice to the other party providing a reasonable opportunity to cure given the nature of 
         the breach, in no event to be less than thirty (30) days; or 
     (b) by BEA upon any action by You alleging that use or distribution of the TCK or an implementation of the JCP Specification by BEA or any of BEA's licensees of the TCK 
         infringes a patent owned by You.
